## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your distant server:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the application.
- **pip**: Python package installer.
- **Virtualenv**: For creating isolated Python environments.
- **Docker** (optional): If you prefer using Docker.

---

## Clone the Repository

First, log into your distant server via SSH:

```bash
ssh username@your-distant-server-ip




Certainly! Here is the section you requested, rewritten in proper Markdown syntax for direct copy-pasting into your README.md file.

Copy code
## Clone the Repository

Then, clone the repository to your working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops-template.git
cd mlops-template
Set Up the Environment
On the Distant Server
Run the Setup Script
The setup.sh script automates the environment setup by installing all necessary dependencies and creating a virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
bash setup.sh
Activate the Virtual Environment
After the setup script completes, activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Verify Installation
Ensure that all Python packages are installed correctly:

bash
Copy code
pip list
You should see numpy, pandas, tensorflow, jupyter, and other dependencies listed.

Using Docker
If you prefer to use Docker, follow these steps:

Install Docker
Ensure Docker is installed on your distant server. If not, install it using:

bash
Copy code
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
make docker-build
Run the Docker Container
Run the container, mapping the necessary ports:

bash
Copy code
make docker-run
This command will start the container and expose port 8888 for Jupyter Notebook.

Running the Application
With the environment set up, you can now run the application.

If Using Virtual Environment
Ensure the virtual environment is activated:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Run the main application:

bash
Copy code
make run
If Using Docker
The application is already running inside the Docker container if you used make docker-run. To execute commands inside the running container, you can attach to it:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=mlops-template) /bin/bash
Running Tests
To run unit tests and ensure everything is working correctly:

bash
Copy code
make test
This command will execute all tests located in the tests/ directory.

Accessing Jupyter Notebook
Via Docker
Find the Token
When the Docker container starts, it will output a URL containing a token. Copy this URL.

Access Jupyter Notebook
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL, replacing localhost with your distant server's IP address:

ruby
Copy code
http://your-distant-server-ip:8888/?token=your_token_here
Note: Ensure that port 8888 is open on your distant server's firewall.

Locally on the Server
If you prefer to run Jupyter Notebook directly on the server without Docker:

Activate Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Start Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888
SSH Tunneling
From your local machine, create an SSH tunnel to the distant server:

bash
Copy code
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 username@your-distant-server-ip
Access Jupyter Notebook
Open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8888
Enter the token provided when you started Jupyter Notebook.

Cleaning Up
To clean up generated files and environments:

bash
Copy code
make clean
This command will remove the virtual environment and any temporary files.

Additional Information
Data Directory
Place any datasets in the data/ directory. This directory is ignored by Git to prevent large files from being committed.

Configuration
Environment Variables
If you have environment-specific variables, create a .env file in the root directory and add it to .gitignore.

Extending the Project
Add additional Python packages to requirements.txt.
Implement new features in the src/ directory.
Add new notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
Troubleshooting
Permission Denied Errors
If you encounter permission errors when running setup.sh, ensure it has execute permissions:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x setup.sh
Python Version Issues
Ensure that the Python version on the distant server meets the minimum requirement (Python 3.8+). Check your Python version:

bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Virtual Environment Not Activating
If source venv/bin/activate doesn't work, the virtual environment may not have been created correctly. Try deleting the venv/ directory and running setup.sh again.

Docker Build Failures
Ensure Docker is running and you have the necessary permissions. You might need to add your user to the docker group:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then log out and log back in.

Jupyter Notebook Not Accessible
Verify that port 8888 is open on your distant server's firewall.
Ensure you're using the correct IP address and token.
If using SSH tunneling, ensure the tunnel is established correctly.
